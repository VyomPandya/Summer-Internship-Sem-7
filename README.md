## 📅 Week 1 Breakdown

### 1. Onboarding & Analytics Foundations
- **Concepts Covered**  
  - Analytics lifecycle, data types (structured, unstructured, semi-structured)  
- **Environment Setup**  
  - Installed Anaconda (Jupyter), Microsoft Excel, Power BI Desktop (Tableau Public installed as an alternative)  
- **Courses & Tutorials**  
  - Completed IBM’s beginner analytics YouTube playlist  
- **Hands-On Task**  
  - Imported a sample CSV into Excel, calculated averages, created pivot tables & charts  

### 2. Data Cleaning & Manipulation in Excel & Python
- **Key Topics**  
  - Handling missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats  
- **Excel Practice**  
  - Cleaned a “messy” dataset by removing duplicates and standardizing date formats  
- **Python & Pandas**  
  - Loaded the Titanic dataset; used `df.info()`, `df.describe()`; imputed missing ages; dropped irrelevant columns  

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**  
  - Central tendency, dispersion, correlation  
- **Visualization Tools**  
  - Used `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for histograms, boxplots, heatmaps  
  - Generated an automated EDA report with `pandas_profiling`  
- **Notebook Deliverable**  
  - Jupyter Notebook documenting insights and annotated graphs  

### 4. Data Visualization Tools
- **Power BI Introduction**  
  - Data import, Query Editor, Report Canvas overview  
- **Dashboard Prototype**  
  - Regional sales slicers; KPIs for revenue & profit margin  
- **Next Steps**  
  - Replicate in Tableau Public with interactive map and filters  

### 5. SQL for Data Analytics
- **Core SQL Skills**  
  - SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, aggregate functions  
- **Practice Platforms**  
  - Mode Analytics, HackerRank  
- **Business Queries**  
  - Solved 10 real-world queries on a sample eCommerce dataset  
- **Integration**  
  - Connected Azure SQL to Power BI for live visualization  

### 6. Capstone Project Initiation
- **Dataset Selection**  
  - Titanic dataset from Kaggle  
- **Scope & Deliverables**  
  1. Data cleaning & preprocessing  
  2. EDA & insights  
  3. Interactive dashboard (Power BI/Tableau)  
  4. Final report & mentor presentation
